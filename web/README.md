# Frontend Code

This is the front end code of our project. It utilizes React and CSS in order to obtain information from the user.

# Screens
There are 6 screens to our code.

# 1. Kiosk Scren
The Kiosk Screen is made to connect with hardware that differs from the remaining screens. This is because the Kiosk screen serves the purpose of informing users when they walk in and hence, it would be displayed to them at all times when they are in the store.

# 2. Sign In/Register Screen
This screen starts the main page for the user get informaton from and interact with (either directly with their devices or via a cashier who helps). There are options to sign in or register. Sign in is chosen if user is already a member, else register. The Sign In screen takes in a username and password and Register takes in first & last name, username, and password. 

# 3. Eligibility Screen
This screen serves the purpose of verifying if the user is eligible for a discount. Based on their answers to the following questions, they may recieve a discount: "Are you part of SNAP??", "Are you part of EBT", and "Do you live in public hoursing?". If an individual answers yes to either of these questions, they are eligible for a discount.

# 4. User Information Screen
After registering and completing the eligibility screen or after signing in, the user's information is displayed, including thier name, username, id, discount, and number of stars.  Users recieve a certain number of stars based on the health value of the food you purchase. After users recieve a certain number of stars, they are rewarded.

# 7. Shop Screen
This screen displays information of products that are displayed in the store. It contains the name, image, and description of the product. Users also can get to know about the product of the day, which may be determined based on most sells or healthy item of the week.

# 8. Feedback Screen
Feedback allows the user to share how they feel about their experience and food with the store. They have 5 questions, where there are to answer based on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being a low rating and 5 being a high (good) rating.
