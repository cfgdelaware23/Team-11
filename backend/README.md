## Schemas
There are four database schemas to our code.

The feedback schema stores user's usernames and numeric values for four variables: nutrition, affordability, satisfaction, and ease. The username is stored to track the unique feedback that each customer gives. Nutrition, affordability, ease, and satisfaction all store an number between one and five answering the following questions respectively - how nutrious would you rank our food, how affordable are our products to you, how easy has the process regarding membership, and how satisfied are you with Wellfare?

###     2. Income categories
The income categories schema stores user's usernames and boolean values for three variables: publicHousing, EBT, and SNAP. The username is used to identify which user the values correspond to. If a user qualifies for a program, its variable value will be set to true.
